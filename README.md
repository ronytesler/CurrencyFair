Hi,
Included:
- Infinite scrolling
- Offline mode
- Caching
- Tapping on image and viewing it in full screen
- Certificate pinning

Not included:
- Allow rotation (allowed only when showing a photo in full screen)
- tests
- better ui/ux, and comments.
- better performance on edge cases of the recycler/adapter.
- retrying policy (of https calls)

Please let me know if I should spend more time to add anything.

Thanks!
